# hashed_loop

This is a collections of scripts for closing loops in pdb files (or silent files) as an add-on for the Rosetta protein suite.

## Installation Instructions:

If you have a prebuilt table:
<br/>
<code> LOOP_XBIN_HF5=/path/to/loop.hf5 </code><br/>
<code> python -m pip install git+https://github.com/dmitropher/hashed_loop.git </code>

Otherwise:
<br/>
<code> python -m pip install git+https://github.com/dmitropher/hashed_loop.git </code>

If you don't have a prebuilt table, you will have to use build_hash_loop_table.py to build a table and set it as default.

A link to a prebuilt table will be included in future releases
